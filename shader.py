i will lets some without these test again if it works

i tried installing the addon in different version

its the same thing as before i can‚Äôt enable it
only after enable the button shows up

can i have the button show up along with the Remove part ?

I did not get that error when I enabled your addon you sent me

I think because you already had it installed maybe
SkdSam ‚Äî 7/6/2024 9:43 PM

Is this for local mysql database?
If it is just use the sqlite3
My nodes let you make/edit/delete so on in the database
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî 7/6/2024 9:48 PM
i had already that main code with mysql ‚Ä¶so didn‚Äôt try it
i am not that good at this will have to spend a lot time trying to figure other outü•≤
SkdSam ‚Äî 7/6/2024 9:50 PM

My nodes make it easy they even let you create the db file and setup what you need as a table then you can use different nodes to add items or update or delete them. the demo file has it all setup for you to test and play with
Just need to edit the asset settings so it goes to your desktop or folder and not reference mine
You will need to replace the snippet nodes also with your own that you install from my shared zip as they also will give errors as they are refencing a snippet based on my location
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî 7/6/2024 9:55 PM
ahh yess‚Ä¶interesting, i will just spend some time analysing the node and setup my addon with this
SkdSam ‚Äî 7/6/2024 9:56 PM
Image
Install the snippets and then replace the files in the demo with the same snippet nodes, once done then shift r to rebuild and it will remove the errors as snippets are pathways to a json file that will error as mine are in my onedrive and the file is referencing that location and not the one on your computer
Image
Also change this location for the asset so it is the folder you want to use to save your db file
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî 7/6/2024 10:01 PM
ohh wait this is local?üò≠
SkdSam ‚Äî 7/6/2024 10:03 PM
Yeah its a file on the users pc
Are you trying to use another location?
Just seen what you are trying to do
Link to an external location use the mac address as part of the key to then see if the users details are in the database and then activiate the adddon
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî 7/6/2024 10:07 PM
yesss!
so you mentioned onedrive‚Ä¶so it can be maintained online to check and update ? 
SkdSam ‚Äî 7/6/2024 10:08 PM
No one drive stores my snippets so I can use them on any PC without having to have them on that PC and transfering them to my other PC

I got chat to update the code to take json, this may work, you will need to test it but if you are only going to update the schemes then this will let you replace just the json file and not have to update the addon.
Image should be the json file as a asset
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî Yesterday at 9:35 PM
thankyou so much ! this for sure helps

Just working on a node to read json and save it to another file. This may work with online json also so like a github link

OK, just made a node that will let you copy the https://gitlab.com/skdsam/serpens-packages/-/raw/main/package_info.json data and then save it into the json file on a device

KiLLSHOT ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:17 PM
It shows up in blender version 4.4 but not in 3.6
SkdSam ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:21 PM
What do you mean?
I have not tested but in Blender 3.6 did you download my packages addon and install it to Blender 3.6?
https://design-demo.co.uk/scripting/

Go here and download the addon using the download button, in blender 4.2 or above you can drag the box into Blender to install

SkdSam ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:24 PM
Once you have the addon installed go to the preference and then inside the Serpens packages addon click install packages then after it has done restart Blender
When you update packages you have to restart Blender for it to use them as Blender loads nodes on start up only and not in realtime
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:25 PM
i did , even  the update you pushed....it showed update . Restarted still nothing there
but showed of first try in 4.4
SkdSam ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:26 PM
I changed the node name to copy jason data
Might be the reason you dont see the node as save json data was the last name of the node
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:28 PM
should i continue in 4.4 or like download 4.2. might be time say goodbye to 3.6üòÇ
SkdSam ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:29 PM
Up to you, the packages should work in 3.6
Can you share a screen grab of what is missing?
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:31 PM
the install and everything seems to work , just the Skd package nodes dont show up  in the list
SkdSam ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:31 PM
OK
So the addon installed, and you went into preferences an then used the install packages button. Closed and restarted Blender?

No problem, if the code works with the json file then your golden.. I use gitkraken to push my stuff to github as it sees the change file and just uploads it.. Its free this way you just open the app edit the file press commit and then it sends it to Github for you. Also it stores the history of the file so you can revert back if needed

That's really cool , i was confused my addon has some 300mb blend file in as asset so like just having to update small part would be a better way
SkdSam ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:52 PM
Should not be that large if it is just nodes and code
Go orphan files and purge unused items

Been messing around with a lot of cloud stuff and every bit of data makes me feel thats going to costüòÇüò≠
SkdSam ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:53 PM
How many Serpens properties does your addon have?
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:54 PM
properties as in
SkdSam ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:54 PM
Image
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:55 PM
4
SkdSam ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:55 PM
OK
Lets try this
Open a new blender file
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:55 PM
in
SkdSam ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:56 PM
Create them properties in the new file so they have same names and settings
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:57 PM
done
SkdSam ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:57 PM
After you done this, append node trees from your addon Blender .. This should import the nodes and use the same properties it had and then save it .. It should pull any scripts so on..
Now you should have your Blender addon in the new Blender file and a smaller file size
You might have to also add the assets up again if you had any assets
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:59 PM
yeaa the assets
SkdSam ‚Äî 12:01 AM
You just need to add them links in the new Blender file and it should reduce your Blender file size
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî 12:01 AM
yup the blend size is way smaller now
also seems it had some of the textures from testing
SkdSam ‚Äî 12:03 AM
Keep your other file but if it is all working once you have it all set with assets then you have a smaller addon file now
Add that new Blender file to the same folder as your larger one and work in that file then you have a quicker loading file.. You may have to delete the node tree that was default in the new Blend file
Visual Scripting Editor if you have Visual Scripting Editor.001 or if you had named the node trees to new names then just remove the one you are not using and your all set
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî 12:05 AM
yup removed the default one ü´°
SkdSam ‚Äî 12:06 AM
Just check your nodes that are referencing the properties are not in red colour and are seeing the correct node tree and property
I think it ports over variables but check they are in the file also if you had any
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî 12:07 AM
Yup no red colors üëåüèª
will work on this one from now
SkdSam ‚Äî 12:07 AM
Perfect , shift r to compile and it should show the UI correct and have no errors if all worked
Now you most likely have 10mb file ü§£

KiLLSHOT ‚Äî 12:09 AM
yessüòõ
SkdSam ‚Äî 12:09 AM
Yeah assets will get packed into the addon but wont be in the main addon Blender file so it should stay small
By the way whats it do?
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî 12:10 AM
thats barely 4mbs
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî 12:10 AM
sets up material for cod assets

also like apply camos for weapon and some rigging stuff
SkdSam ‚Äî 12:15 AM
Nice, so ripping the models out and then using them to animate inside Blender?
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî 12:17 AM
yes for ripping is a different tool, mines just for in blender
SkdSam ‚Äî 12:18 AM
Yeah, It would need to be a C coding tool to rip the data..

a few i made
last one was actually a custom model , got a 3d scan made a meta human out of it and put the head on a cod model with some custom textures
SkdSam ‚Äî 12:23 AM
You could simulate the setting of the size of the model on import to 0.011 or what ever it was in the video
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî 12:25 AM
yea i did that before but removed it , many used some tool to connect the body and head before importing and that would mess things up
so left it unchanged
SkdSam ‚Äî 12:26 AM
Well now if the stuff we did worked the updating of the json file will be good for quick updates and not having to role out a new version
KiLLSHOT ‚Äî 12:27 AM
yup , with new models those mapping would change every now and then so it will definitely be great
will continue working on that tomorrow
again thanks for all the help
